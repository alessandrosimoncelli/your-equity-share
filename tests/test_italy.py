Phase one of the Italian tool changes the equity sleeve from the S&P 500 to a
global index, the safe asset from a 30-year TIPS to a euro inflation-linked
bond, and the retirement benefit replacement rate from 40% to 74%. It changes
nothing else in the human capital half, because nothing else in it can be
changed from outside Choi's fitted coefficients.

These tests exist to keep that honest in both directions: that the one Italian
constant really is Italian and sits inside the grid Choi solved over, and that
the rest is still American and still says so. They also refuse to let a
number nobody has measured be presented as though somebody had.
